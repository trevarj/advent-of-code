## 2019 Haskell 󰲒
Retroactively doing this year to experiment with Haskell again to see if I'm
still really stupid. 

## 2022: Haskell 󰲒
Learning Haskell for the first time. I already know a bit of the FP concepts
and syntax from exploring dependent types using Idris, so basically winging it
from there.

## 2023: OCaml 🐪
I didn't want to spend so much time with a new language, so I just decided on
one I've already dabbled with.
