## My Advent of Code Solutions (https://adventofcode.com)

## 2019 Haskell Û∞≤í
Retroactively doing this year to experiment with Haskell again to see if I'm
still really stupid. 

## 2022: Haskell Û∞≤í
Learning Haskell for the first time. I already know a bit of the FP concepts
and syntax from exploring dependent types using Idris, so basically winging it
from there.

## 2023: OCaml üê™
I didn't want to spend so much time with a new language, so I just decided on
one I've already dabbled with.

## 2024: Emacs Lisp Óò≤
Trying to have a fun and cozy time. Using the great library
[dash.el](https://github.com/magnars/dash.el) and not going for efficient
solutions until Emacs locks up and crashes.
