## 2022: Haskell Û∞òß
Learning Haskell for the first time. I already know a bit of the FP concepts
and syntax from exploring dependent types using Idris, so basically winging it
from there.

## 2023: OCaml üê™
I didn't want to spend so much time with a new language, so I just decided on
one I've already dabbled with.
